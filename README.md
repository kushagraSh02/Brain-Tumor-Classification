# Brain-Tumor-Classification
A CNN made to classify Brain Tumor in MRI images of patients.

Made as a project for my SoftComputing Course in college.



The Dataset contains 4 sets of images namely - glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor and notumor. 
Our model takes an image as input and determnines (from above classes) which class the image belongs to.
Due to the small sample size in our Dataset we have also used additional techniques like ImageDataGenerator to maximize feature extraction from the images.
Model contains 6 Convolutional and 3 dense layers and there are 4 outputs corresponding to the four classes of tumors in our dataset.
